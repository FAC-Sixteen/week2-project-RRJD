## :honeybee: Overview  
> Created by: @jokosanyang @rymatech @dalmano @rohanSSS

This repo contains our Founders and Coders Week 2 project. We were given a [skeleton](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/week-2/project) of a to-do app, and used Test Driven Development and DOM manipulation to develop it into a functional app.

The website is live on GitHub pages. Access it using [this link](https://fac-sixteen.github.io/week2-project-RRJD/)!

## 🏋️‍ What we struggled with  
* understanding the argument variables
>     "IS IT AN ARRAY OR AN OBJECT?!"
>     "It's an array of objects."

* understand the tape testing format
>     "Does that go in 'actual' or 'expected'?!
>     What are they testing for?!"
>     "It turns out actual or expected are just variables.
>     We decide what they're testing for."
